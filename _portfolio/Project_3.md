collection: Projects
permalink: /portfolio/Project_3
excerpt: 'Utilized natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to extract valuable insights from a movie dataset. Developed a content-based movie recommendation system that suggests films based on similarities in movie descriptions, leveraging NLP to analyze and compare textual data. Implemented multilabel genre classification by analyzing movie overviews, enabling the categorization of films into multiple genres simultaneously. Additionally, predicted movie ratings using various features such as genre, budget, and revenue, applying machine learning methods and feature importance analysis.'
