collection: Projects
permalink: /portfolio/Project_0
excerpt: 'Analyzed healthcare accessibility in Toronto to identify optimal locations for new facilities and improve emergency response. Applied spatial analysis techniques, including spatial clustering and kernel density estimation (KDE), to locate areas with high demand and underserved populations. Utilized Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) for estimating healthcare demand and identifying suitable new facility locations. Employed road network analysis with Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest routes to existing facilities, enhancing emergency response strategies.'
